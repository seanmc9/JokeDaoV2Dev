            <p><b>Tip:</b> In order to submit an image or gif, make sure that you submit only the link and that the link begins with "https://" and it is a direct link to the image file (it will end in .jpg or the file type of the media).</p>

Just plug in the Contest address of the jokerace that is using those tokens (propose a joke if the race is currently queued or vote if the voting period is open)!</p>

                        <p>Cool! We suggest checking out the above adventure (I'd like to vote on something amongst a group of people!) for going from 0 to 1 on making a token, distributing it to the people you'd like to vote, making a contest, and getting going - just that group of people would be the members of your DAO!</p>

                      <li>Deciding which board game to play amongst friends but the one that gets the second most votes wins!</li>
                      <li>Do a decentralized Twitter poll by giving out tokens to your followers and having them vote in a contest where the results will be stored on-chain and you can see who voted for what!</li>
                      <li>If you are building a product, give tokens to your users and ask them to propose and vote on which features they would like to see implemented next!</li>
